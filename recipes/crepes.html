  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This simple but delicious crêpe recipe can be made in minutes from ingredients that everyone has on hand.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>½ cup milk</li>
    <li>½ cup water</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps to make</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Whisk flour and eggs together in a large mixing bowl; gradually add in milk and water, stirring to combine.
       Add salt and melted butter; beat until smooth.</li>
    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, 
      using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
    <li>Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around 
      the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.</li>
  </ol>
